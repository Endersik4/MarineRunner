## MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077 My biggest and most ambitious project. <br/>
It's an FPS Shooter with speedy movement made in Unreal Engine 5 using C++. <br/>
Players can use mechanics such as wall running, a grappling hook, sliding, slow motion, and more to navigate the demo. <br/>
The game features 5 different types of weapons and 5 different enemy types. <br/>
Players also have a robot companion, Albertos, who can create items like medkits, ammo, and weapons, and stores all the items the player collects. <br/>
The main objective is to kill everyone due to a betrayal, but the story takes an unexpected turn.<br/><br/>

I made everything in this game, except for the Music and Sounds. <br/> 
The <a href="https://github.com/Endersik4/MarineRunner/blob/main/ListOfAllFeatures.md"> List of All Features </a> explains nearly every game mechanic briefly. spoiler: it's long. <br/> <br/>

I started this project on January 23, 2023, and finished on June 26, 2024 with some breaks for final exams. It took nearly 2300 hours to make. <br/>
The game is in state to be shipped. <br/> 

I made demo for ZTGK contest with new features. <br/>
The new demo includes the best elements from the previous demo based on the great feedback I received and is shorter for a more focused experience.<br/>
