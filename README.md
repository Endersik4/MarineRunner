# MarineRunner

MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077. My biggest and most ambitious project <br/>
It's time for more complex games, not some tiny ones. <br/>
I wanted to create movement like in Ghostrunner and shooting mechanic like in Cyberpunk 2077 <br/>
The game is in development, there is still a lot to do.<br/>
I started this project on 27.01.2023 and on the day 15.05.2023 I have spent 570h on this game (454 Unreal Engine, 116 Blender) <br/>
MarineRunner is on Unreal Engine 5. <br/>
(everything is code from scratch in C++ with Unreal Engine tools)<br/>
<br/>
Demo of MarineRunner to show current status. <br/>
Its just demo for showcase, I plan to add more things in the future such as <br/>
Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Granade Launcher or Grenades, more enemies and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFB4vfd2Eg"> cute-little robot friend </a> to help you with some things <br/>
And probably this level will never in used in the future because i have other plans for this game in level design. <br/>
