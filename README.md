# MarineRunner

## MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077 My biggest and most ambitious project. <br/>
It was time for more complex games, not some tiny ones. <br/>
I wanted to create movement like in Ghostrunner and shooting mechanics like in Cyberpunk 2077 <br/>
The game is in development, there is still a lot to do. <br/>
I started this project on 27.01.2023 and by 31.07.2023 I have spent **953h** on this game (673 Unreal Engine, 280 Blender). <br/>
MarineRunner runs on Unreal Engine 5. <br/>
(Everything is coded from scratch in C++ using Unreal Engine tools). 
<br/>

### <a href="https://youtu.be/UozAfLmbgF0"> MarineRunner demo </a> to show the current status.  <br/>
This is just a demo for demonstration, I plan to add more things in the future.  <br/>
Currently the game features: <br/>
**-Dash**<br/>
**-Slow Motion**<br/>
**-Grappling Hook**<br/>
**-Sliding**<br/>
**-Pull up on the edge**<br/>
**-Wallrun.** <br/>
**-Picking up and dropping items** <br/>
**-chest with random items or resources with or without a pin** <br/>
**-exploding barrels**  <br/>
**-Five different types of weapons** - pistol, machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade launcher  <br/>
**-Five different types of enemies** - enemy with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a grenade launcher <br/>
**-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFB4vfd2Eg"> ALBERTOS** </a> - a robot friend that can craft items such as ammunition, weapons, first aid kits....  <br/>
This robot also has an inventory that stores everything you can pick up (resources, weapons, ammunition...).  <br/>
**-and more...**<br/><br/>

And this level will never be used in the future, because I have other plans for this game in level design.  <br/>
