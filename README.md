# MarineRunner

MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077 + High On Life. My biggest and most ambitious project <br/>
It's time for more complex games, not some tiny ones. <br/>
This game has movement like in Ghostrunner. <br/> 
Shooting mechanics like in Cyberpunk 2077 and style like High On Life (but that wasn't on purpose).<br/>
The game is in development, there is still a lot to do.<br/>
MarineRunner is on Unreal Engine 5. <br/>
(everything is code from scratch with Unreal Engine tools)
