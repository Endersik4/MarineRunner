# MarineRunner

MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077 My biggest and most ambitious project. <br/>
It was time for more complex games, not some tiny ones. <br/>
I wanted to create movement like in Ghostrunner and shooting mechanics like in Cyberpunk 2077 <br/>
The game is in development, there is still a lot to do. <br/>
I started this project on 27.01.2023 and by 31.07.2023 I have spent 953h on this game (673 Unreal Engine, 280 Blender). <br/>
MarineRunner runs on Unreal Engine 5. <br/>
(Everything is coded from scratch in C++ using Unreal Engine tools).

 <a href="https://youtu.be/UozAfLmbgF0"> MarineRunner demo </a> to show the current status.  <br/>
This is just a demo for demonstration, I plan to add more things in the future.  <br/>
Currently the game features: <br/>
-<i>Dash</i> <br/>
-Slow Motion<br/>
-Grappling Hook<br/>
-Sliding<br/>
-Pull up on the edge<br/>
-Wallrun.  <br/>
Picking up and dropping items, chest with random items or resources with or without a pin, exploding barrels  <br/>
Five different types of weapons - pistol, machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade launcher  <br/>
Five different types of enemies - enemy with a pistol, a machine gun, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, a grenade launcher <br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFB4vfd2Eg"> ALBERTOS </a> - a robot friend that can craft items such as ammunition, weapons, first aid kits....  <br/>
This robot also has an inventory that stores everything you can pick up (resources, weapons, ammunition...).  <br/>
And probably this level will never be used in the future, because I have other plans for this game in level design.  <br/>
