# MarineRunner

## MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077 My biggest and most ambitious project. <br/>
FPS Shooter with fast movement.
Everything in this game was made by me, except Music and Sounds. <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Endersik4/MarineRunner/blob/main/ListOfAllFeatures.md"> List of All Features </a> contains almost every mechanic with short description. spoiler: its long. <br/>
I started this project on 23.01.2023 and finished on 23.02.2024, took nearly 2000 hours to make. <br/>
The game is now in state that can be shipped. <br/>
I created the demo (30 minutes long) to show everything that the game has to offer <br/>
I plan to go with this game to the contest - ZTGK in june 2024 <br/>
