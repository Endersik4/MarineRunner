# MarineRunner

MarineRunner = Ghostrunner + Cyberpunk 2077. My biggest and most ambitious project <br/>
It's time for more complex games, not some tiny ones. <br/>
I wanted to create movement like in Ghostrunner and shooting mechanic like in Cyberpunk 2077 <br/>
The game is in development, there is still a lot to do.<br/>
I started this project on 27.01.2023 and on the day 15.05.2023 I have spent 953h on this game (673 Unreal Engine, 280 Blender) <br/>
MarineRunner is on Unreal Engine 5. <br/>
(everything is code from scratch in C++ with Unreal Engine tools)<br/>
<br/>
Demo of MarineRunner to show current status. <br/>
Its just demo for showcase, I plan to add more things in the future. <br/>
Currently the game has: Dash, Slow Motion, Grappling Hook, Sliding, Pull up on the edge, Wallrun <br/>
Take and Drop Items, Chest with random items or resources with pin or without, Explosion Barrels <br/>
Five different types of Weapon - Pistol, Machine Gun, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Granade Launcher  <br/>
Five different types of Enemies - Pistol enemy, Machine Gun enemy, Shotgun enemy, Sniper Rifle enemy, Granade Launcher enemy  <br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtFB4vfd2Eg"> ALBERTOS </a> - robot friend that can craft items such as ammunitions, weapons, first aid kit... <br/>
This robot also has a inventory that stores everythink that can be picked (resources, weapons, ammunitons..) <br/>
And probably this level will never in used in the future because i have other plans for this game in level design. <br/>
